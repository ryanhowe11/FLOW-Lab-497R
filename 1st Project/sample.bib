abstract = {As we are moving towards future, our natural energy resources are exploited day by day so we have to limit our usage for future generation but simultaneously our need is also increasing drastically so we cannot limit our self by using them, but we can modify/alter the design of object so that we can increase the fuel efficiency. As wings are made of Airfoil section, so we can increase the lift force corresponding to drag force generated by the flow of air over airfoil section. The main motive of this study is to compare coefficient of lift and coefficient of drag at different angle of attack for constant air velocity at different airfoil sections provided by The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). We selected NACA 2412, NACA 2414 and NACA 2415 using Computational Fluid Dynamics. To obtain the solution we have to solve steady state governing equations, momentum equations with standard k-epsilon viscous model. The geometry is first imported in design modular of ANSYS, and then import the file into Ansys15 software using Fluent as a solver and CFD â€“ Post as post processor.}
